- Hashtables
- Opening book
- Endgame tablebase (e.g. Syzygy)
- Reduce number calls to controlled_squares (curr. 400k)
- Reduce number calls to is_enemy (curr. 20M)
	- Although is_enemy is constant time (close to 10 instr), getting called 20M times means that it still takes up around 10% of total program execution time
